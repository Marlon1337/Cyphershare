This is a crawler bot which is scheduled everyday.
It should detect piracy links from pages which were added to the 'source' field during our abuse form on https://callsoft.tech/abuse-form .
You are invited to suggest improvements to improve the efficiency with our script.
Problems we are facing for which we would love some help with:
1. New IPs which are not blocked from Captcha and bot detection services
2. Better detecting new page layouts and honeypot buttons
